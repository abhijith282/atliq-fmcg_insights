## ❗ Problem Statement

Recently, several **key customers** have not renewed their annual contracts, citing **poor service quality** as a major reason. Internal investigations suggest:

- 🚫 Essential products were **not delivered on time**
- 📦 Some deliveries were **not fulfilled completely**
- 🤝 Resulted in **customer dissatisfaction** and a risk to business growth

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To address these challenges, AtliQ Mart’s **Supply Chain Analytics Team** was tasked with:

> 📍 Tracking service-level metrics on a **daily basis** for all customer orders.

This initiative aims to enable **swift corrective action** and build a data-backed foundation for reliable customer service.

## 📐 Service Level Metrics

The team adopted a **standardized framework** to monitor and improve delivery performance using the following KPIs:

- ✅ **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**  
  Measures whether products were delivered **on or before the scheduled date**

- ✅ **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**  
  Measures whether the **entire quantity ordered** was delivered

- ✅ **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**  
  Measures whether deliveries were both **on time and in full**

Each customer has a **target service level**, and actual performance is benchmarked against it **daily**.
